                                      <h3>Augmented Reality & Dissection<br/></h3>
                                      <h4>Tangible and Embodied Interaction</h4>
                                      <p style="font-size:18px; font-style: normal;"> 
                                          This project researches how augmented reality could be used for anatomy teaching. 
                                          We utilized a combination of existing augmented reality software with support for handheld 
                                          devices. We created prototypes of simple anatomy models for the 
                                          physical counterpart of the virtual models. The models were equipped with simple sensors for 
                                          determining the state of the model, for instance picking apart the chest cavity in order to render 
                                          the visuals accordingly. The wizard of oz technique was used as well for simulating 
                                          interaction with the artifact that is not possible to prototype within the given timeframe.
                                      </p>
                                      <br>

                                       <!--  <h3> What we started with</h3>
                                       <p> The aim of this case study is to implement AR into the dissection aspect since dissection at times could be deemed as 
                                          an  unideal  experience  for  students.  Utilizing  AR  could  present  the  idea  of  dissection  gradually  and  minimize  bad 
                                          experiences for students. An example would be that the reaction to smell and blood would be non-existent when using 
                                          AR, however the students would still acquire the same knowledge.
                                          Therefore multiple pitch sketches were created in order to mediate how and what we could do in order to eliminate the problems
                                          students might experience while dissecting real animals while learning biology.

                            <h3>inefficient machine that conducts simple tasks with the help of Arduino</h3>
                            <h4>Playful interactions</h4>
                                <p style="font-size:18px;"> 
                                    An inefficient machine out of a simple task, such as making coffee or juice. 
                                    The idea was to create some sort of machine that would react without any direct input. 
                                    The journey began with a pitch for a kinetic sculpture that would react to noise pollution.
                                    This was a subject of brainstorm and prototyping movements for a couple of weeks, 
                                    until we realised that this would be hard to implement and make interactive, 
                                    since its input would be implicit interactions from noise. Instead we went down another route, 
                                    and found enjoyment in exploring gear movements and how kinetic energy travels through gears. 
                                    The time we spent here was not completely lost, but we felt like we needed a purpose for our gear sculpture - 
                                    otherwise it would just be another gear sculpture you often see at Swedish technical museums.

                            <p>This project was conducted in collaboration with Malmö Civic Lab in order to provide them with a way to improve Förskoleförvaltningens Onboarding process.
                                The project allows the process of introducing new employees to become more efficient and less cumbersome 
                                for everyone involved. We worked in order to provide the right information and equipment for the newly employed at the right time.
                                And finally we wanted to create an easier and faster way, for the newly employed to becoming part of the workplace based team 
                                and allow them to feel equal to their colleagues. Due to confidential information, I will not be able to provide all details 
                                regarding the project. However, I am able to provide sketches, userjourneys, and prototypes, etc.</p>

                                    <p> This thesis project explores and investigates the potential benefits of
                                        implementing Augmented Reality as an educational support tool for dyslexic students in
                                        higher education. This was conducted through three design explorations
                                        which investigate if the characteristic of AR holds any potential benefits for
                                        the participants while reading academic papers. These design explorations
                                        were created in the form of prototypes which explore and investigate how well
                                        AR could increase the readability in comparison to already existing
                                        technology, applications, and physical tools which is currently being used by
                                        dyslexic students. Main findings from the user-testings, indicate that
                                        augmented reality could allow the students to maneuver easily through
                                        multiple papers, increase readability of different texts, and that AR holds
                                        multiple benefits compared to traditional more commonly used educational
                                        support tools.

                                    <p>The aim of this thesis project is to investigate and explore the potential
                                        benefits of implementing AR as an educational support tool for dyslexic
                                        students in higher education. The exploration and investigation will be
                                        conducted through a series of design explorations which will investigate if the
                                        characteristic of AR holds any potential benefits for students in higher
                                        education, who suffer from dyslexia, while reading academic papers. If the
                                        characteristics of the technology could support their reading process, it could
                                        provide the students with a higher possibility of reading academic papers and
                                        in the long run support their studies. The results of the explorations are
                                        evaluated to identify potential benefits of using AR to support dyslexic users
                                        in comparison to the already existing technology, applications and physical
                                        tools which they are currently using.
                                        <br>Research questions:
                                        <br>1. In what ways can AR support students when reading academic
                                        texts in comparison to traditional, more commonly used
                                        educational support tools for students with dyslexia?<br>
                                        <br>2. What features of the AR technology are useful for dyslexic
                                        students for improving issues linked to reading of academic
                                        papers?<br>
                                        <br>These questions will be answered by running design explorations where
                                        different AR designs are explored by conducting three different experiments.
                                        Various prototyping methods were used during this thesis project. This thesis
                                        project contains three different prototypes which are presented and usertested with the participants. 
                                        The prototypes are intended to investigate the
                                        possible benefits of implementing AR as an educational support tool for
                                        dyslexic students in higher education.
